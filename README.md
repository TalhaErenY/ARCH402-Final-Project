# ARCH402-Final-Project
Bachelor's graduation thesis project in Alsancak, İzmir.

The project focuses on the former Alsancak Tobacco Monopoly Factory (Eski Alsancak Tekel Fabrikası). The site finished being restored and was reopened as a cultural center the same month I presented this project as my final thesis.

The Monopoly Factory is a French built industrial heritage site from the Late Ottoman Period. Originally owned by the Régie Company, it became part of the state monopoly (Tekel) when the Régie Company was nationalised under the republic. While in reality the Monopoly Factory was opened as a cultural center, I wanted to reimagine another use for it that is needed in İzmir: a university campus. Due to its accessibility by public transport, the Monopoly Factory is in prime location to be converted into an institute of education. It is also not the first of its kind in the area, directly adjacent to the plot is a heritage site hotel and offices that have been converted to a highschool and kindergarten respectively.
