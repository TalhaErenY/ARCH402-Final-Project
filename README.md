# ARCH402-Final-Project
Bachelor's graduation thesis project in Alsancak, İzmir.

*Note: the drawings are presented as loose files due to the inability of computer screens and hardware to view the original 100x140cm poster as a whole at viewable quality. All PDF's are vector based and can be zoomed infinitely.*

The project focuses on the former Alsancak Tobacco Monopoly Factory (Eski Alsancak Tekel Fabrikası). The site finished being restored and was reopened as a cultural center the same month I presented this project as my final thesis.

The Monopoly Factory is a French built industrial heritage site from the Late Ottoman Period. Originally owned by the Régie Company, it became part of the state monopoly (Tekel) when the Régie Company was nationalised under the republic. While in reality the Monopoly Factory was opened as a cultural center, I wanted to reimagine another use for it that is needed in İzmir: a university campus. Due to its accessibility by public transport, the Monopoly Factory is in prime location to be converted into an institute of education. It is also not the first of its kind in the area, directly adjacent to the plot is a heritage site hotel and offices that have been converted to a highschool and kindergarten respectively.

The greater project area encompasses the 9 buildings of the former factory, the former TCDD (national railway) offices on the opposite side of the railway, and an empty plot to the south of the factory.

Around 1/3rd of the district of Konak, İzmir was modelled using aid of AutoCAD, Rhino and Blender for the project. The original city plan provided as a dwg file was converted to 3D buildings in rhino+grasshopper, which were then exported to blender and combined with the topography and textured using satellite imagery and procedural texture generation (for the sides of buildings). *Every background building visible in the project is has its real height*. The entire district model can be found in its respective page on my github.

The entirety of the Tobacco Monopoly Factory (inside and outside) was modelled in Revit using aid from the survey drawings provided by the Turkish Body of Conservation as AutoCAD files. This project can be found on its respective page on my github.
